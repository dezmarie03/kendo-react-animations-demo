# kendo-react-animations-demo

This is a tiny repo of (somewhat) practical demos of applying KendoReact's animation components to banners, menus, and content blocks. My implementation differs slightly from their official documentation in that I'm using the useState hook. 

Components included in the demo:

* Expand
* Fade
* Push
* Reveal
* Slide
* Zoom

To be respectful of [Progress Software's license for KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-agreement/progress-kendoreact), the source code does not include references to their packages. I am not responsible for your violation of their license, should you choose to do anything with my sample code.
